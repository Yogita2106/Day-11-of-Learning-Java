# Day-11-of-Learning-Java
In the day 11 I have learn about the SOCKET PROGRAMMING &amp; TCP and solve problems based on { Calculating and returns Sum ,Responding with Reversed String, Responding the system with date and time, The Character is a Vowel or Consonant}.

The problems are as following:-

Q1. Demonstrate a Java client-server program where the client sends two integers to the server, and the server calculates and returns their sum. Use the class names SumClient 
    for the client and SumServer for the server.
    
Q2. Design a Java client-server application where the client sends a string message, and the server responds with the reversed string. Use ReverseClient and ReverseServer as 
    class names.
    
Q3. Create a Java client-server program where the client requests the current date and time from the server, and the server responds with the system date and time. Use 
    DateClient and DateServer as class names.
    
Q4. Develop a Java client-server application where the client sends a character, and the server responds whether the character is a vowel or consonant. Use CharClient and 
    CharServer as class names.
